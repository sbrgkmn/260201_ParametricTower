# 260201_ParametricTower

Parametric tower experiment built with Three.js and Vite. It simulates a 3D cellular automaton seeded on the ground plane and renders evolving voxel structures with interactive controls.

## Features
- Instanced voxel rendering for large grids
- 3D cellular automaton with adjustable birth/survival rules
- Live GUI controls for grid size, seed density, and animation
- Orbit camera controls and dynamic lighting

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run dev server: `npm run dev -- --host`
3. Open `http://localhost:5173`

## Controls
- Orbit: left mouse drag
- Pan: right mouse drag (or ctrl + left drag)
- Zoom: mouse wheel
- Use the on-screen GUI to tweak grid size, seed density, rules, and playback
